If you clear a model then you lose the id.


Methods on the DashboardReport object
    - save to panel element
        - has and id? - Update the dashboard xml
        - add a new panel element to the dashboard xml
    - Save to report - just calls save
    - delete panel element
    - reset to report format
        - get the id of the report
        - fetch the panel - Do you still want the delta from the panel?
        - fetch the report - from the old id.
        - layer the report onto the panel
        - save the panel element

    - Am I a pivot report?
    - Am I a saved search?
    - Am I a panel? - just an instance of DashboardReport?


    Calling save/delete
        - save panel element (this is what I think)
            - This would allow you to reuse any component that would have already called save on the report objects.
            - only the specific panel element to report views would need
        OR
        - save the report

Manager in the DashboardReport
    - Seems that the manager has a subset of the element of a report.
    - If the id of the report is set, then it is a saved search
        Otherwise it is an inline search
